## Try it Out!

To see this sample app in action, build and run the project, then use the buttons in the sample app's toolbar to take a picture or choose an image from your photo library. The sample app then uses Vision to apply the Core ML model to the chosen image, and shows the resulting classification labels along with numbers indicating the confidence level of each classification. It displays the top two classifications in order of the confidence score the model assigns to each.
